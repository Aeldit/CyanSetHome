### üí≤Features

1. Create homes and teleport to them (you can also : `remove, remove all, rename, list` them)

2. Trust players so they can teleport to your homes (you can also untrust them)

3. See and edit plenty of options, like the minimum OP level required to run a command or simply toggle a functionality

> The home-of commands require the player running the command to be trusted (for `/home-of` and `/get-homes-of`).
>
> All the commands that edit the homes of another player require the player running the command to be OP with
> level `MIN_OP_LVL_BYPASS` and the allowBypass option to be set to `true`
