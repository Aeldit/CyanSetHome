0.1.0 :
    ‚úèÔ∏è Added :
    - The files are now handeled with Gson instead of Properties
    - The homes and trust files that were already present in your folders (.properties files) will be transfered
    automatically to .json files, but won't be removed. To do so, you will have to delete them manually
    (by using a command from this mod or simply by removing them by hand in your folder)

    üöß Fixed :
    - Some options were misleading (minOpLevelExeOPHomeOf, minOpLevelExeHomeOf, ...),
    so I removed them and added only one instead (minOpLevelExeMisc). This option is basically a bypass to for players
    with a certain OP level, like using the homeOf commands even if the player does not have you in their trust list
    - When typing the homeOf commands, the homes of the player you were trying to reach were not suggested

0.1.1 :
    üöß Fixed :
    - When deserializing the json file, I was using 2 map or arrays instead of using a mutable type for the deserialization,
    which may have caused some really small performance issues with a lot of players

    üß™ Dev :
    - Other internal changes to make the code smaller and more readable

0.1.2 :
    ‚úèÔ∏è Added :
    - The command '/cyan removePropertiesFiles' that allows you to transfer properties files to json files and remove
    the properties files once this is done (the properties are transfered to json at the server start, but this is also
    made here just in case)

    üöß Fixed :
    - FileInputStream not being closed, resulting in some errors when trying to delete the file
    - A trusted player could remove another player's home
    - Homes in solo where all saved at the same place, they are now in separate folders (same name as the world they are created for)
    - Homes and Trust systems now use thread-safe classes (`ConcurrentHashMap` and `Collections.synchronizedList`) to prevent any problem
    with concurrent modifications (basically 2 people editing the homes (which then writes in the files) at the same time)

    ü´ß Changed :
    - Use CyanLib 0.3.1

0.1.3 :
    ‚úèÔ∏è Added :
    - Folders created by this mod are now removed if they are empty
    - Translations for the CyanLib rules

    ü´ß Changed :
    - The commands that contains more than 1 word are now separated by a "-" ("/sethome" -> "/set-home")
    - Use CyanLib 0.3.4

0.1.4 :
    ‚úèÔ∏è Added :
    - The `/rename-home` command, that allows you to rename a home

    ü´ß Changed :
    - Use CyanLib 0.3.5 (which allows me to remove the config commands from this mod, as they are now handled in the CyanLib)
    - *(Only uses the last version, it's just to separate the features of each version)* Use CyanLib 0.4.1
      (which adds screen for the configuration on the client, only in solo for now)

    ‚ùå Removed :
    - The `allowHomesOf` option (you can still use the `home-of` command and the trust system, its just the option that was removed)

0.1.5 :
    ‚úèÔ∏è Added :

    - The `/rename-home-of` command that allows the user to rename the home of another player (only if the player running
      the command is OP level 4 and if the `allowByPass` option is set to `true`)
    - The `/set-home-of` command that allows the user to create a home for another player (only if the player running
      the command is OP level 4 and if the `allowByPass` option is set to `true`)

    üöß Fixed :

    - The `/home-trust` command would not write the file when executed
    - Some translations were missing/incorrect

0.1.7 :
    Update to CyanLib 0.4.9 to fix the config not being written when changed from the chat

0.1.8 :
    Fix issue [#3](https://github.com/Aeldit/CyanSetHome/issues/3)

0.1.9 :
    - Fix grammar errors (Fixes [#4](https://github.com/Aeldit/CyanSetHome/issues/4))
    - Upgrade to CyanLib 0.4.14

0.1.10 :
    - Fix the `home-of` commands not suggesting the players names and homes
    - Fix some translation errors with the trust system
    - Fix most of the issues that could have happened with the trust system

0.1.11 :
    - Use CyanLib 0.4.15 to fix translation issues
    - Set the `minOpLvlHomes` option to 0 by default
    - Set the `useXpToTpHome` option to false by default

0.1.12 :
    Add the possibility for players to choose whether XP points or XP levels will be used if the `USE_XP_TP_TP_HOME`
    option is enabled

0.1.13 :
    Fix `getRequiredXpLevelsToTp()` not returning the correct value, as it was called with the position of the player to the
    position of the player, which made the return value always 1 *(basically the xp taken from the player when it teleported
    to a home was always 1)*
