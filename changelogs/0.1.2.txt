Added :
- The command '/cyan removePropertiesFiles' that allows you to transfer properties files to json files and remove
the properties files once this is done (the properties are transfered to json at the server start, but this is also
made here just in case)

Fixed :
- FileInputStream not being closed, resulting in some errors when trying to delete the file
