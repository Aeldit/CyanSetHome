Added :
- The command '/cyan removePropertiesFiles' that allows you to transfer properties files to json files and remove
the properties files once this is done (the properties are transfered to json at the server start, but this is also
made here just in case)

Fixed :
- FileInputStream not being closed, resulting in some errors when trying to delete the file
- A trusted player could remove another player's home
- Homes in solo where all saved at the same place, they are now in separate folders (same name as the world they are created for)
- Homes and Trust systems now use thread-safe classes (`ConcurrentHashMap` and `Collections.synchronizedList`) to prevent any problem
with concurrent modifications (basically 2 people editing the homes (which then writes in the files) at the same time)

Changed :
- Use CyanLib 0.3.1
