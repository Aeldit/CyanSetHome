Added :
- The files are now handeled with Gson instead of Properties
- The homes and trust files that were already present in your folders (.properties files) will be transfered
automatically to .json files, but won't be removed. To do so, you will have to delete them manually
(by using a command from this mod or simply by removing them by hand in your folder)

Fixed :
- Some options were misleading (minOpLevelExeOPHomeOf, minOpLevelExeHomeOf, ...),
so I removed them and added only one instead (minOpLevelExeMisc). This option is basically a bypass to for players
with a certain OP level, like using the homeOf commands even if the player does not have you in their trust list
- When typing the homeOf commands, the homes of the player you were trying to reach were not suggested
